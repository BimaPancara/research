# Demonstration of Multitarget Wireless Sensing Using High-Scanning-Rate Coupled-Patch Antenna

This [paper](paper/Demonstration_of_Multitarget_Wireless_Sensing_Using_High-Scanning-Rate_Coupled-Patch_Antenna.pdf) propose the use of frequency-diverse multitarget wireless sensing system for integrated sensing and communication. The design of coupled-patch antenna with frequency-dependant beam scanning capability is employed.


In this case, the differenct frquency are being use to direct the transmit antenna to a number of receiver.
